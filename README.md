## Introduction

This SQL project is based on [Data Analyst Job Postings [Pay, Skills, Benefits]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukebarousse/data-analyst-job-postings-google-search) dataset by [Luke Barousse](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-b/) hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

This repository provides an SQL analysis of employment listings scraped from Google job search results. The dataset spans from November 4, 2022 through September 9, 2023 using PosgreSQL within a Docker container. 

The goal of this analysis is to gain insight into the skills that are frequently mentioned in the job descriptions, frequency of job postings and basic salary statistics.
